## üïπÔ∏è About the Game  
**Human Expenditure Program** is a narrative-driven psychological horror simulation released in **2025**.  
The game explores what happens when cruelty has no lasting consequences ‚Äî except in the mind of the player.  

You play as **Eun-Mi Harvington**, who has uploaded her husband Harvey‚Äôs consciousness into a simulation.  
- Each **night**, Harvey may be tortured in exchange for money.  
- Each **morning**, his memory is wiped.  
- Only the **player remembers everything**.  

This haunting cycle raises disturbing questions:  
- If suffering is forgotten, does it still matter?  
- Is morality tied to memory, or to action itself?  
- How far will the player go when consequences are erased?

## ‚ö° Features  
- Multiple branching endings shaped by player choices.  
- Minimalist yet oppressive atmosphere.  
- Psychological horror built from responsibility, not jump scares.  
- Standalone narrative that also expands the **BloodMoney!** universe.
